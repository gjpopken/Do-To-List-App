# Do-To-List-App

This is a project that I started on 25 Oct 23, to practice HTML, CSS, and JS. I used ChatGPT to generate the challenge and its parameters: 

Let's create a challenge that involves building an interactive to-do list application. This challenge will allow you to practice your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, particularly focusing on DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

### Challenge: Build a To-Do List Application

**Requirements:**

1. **HTML:**
   - Create an input field for entering tasks.
   - Create an "Add" button to add tasks to the list.
   - Create an empty unordered list (`<ul>`) to display the tasks.
   - Each task item in the list should have a delete button to remove the task.

2. **CSS:**
   - Style the input field, "Add" button, task items, and delete buttons to make the to-do list visually appealing.

3. **JavaScript:**
   - When the "Add" button is clicked, the task entered in the input field should be added as a new task item in the list.
   - Each task item should have a delete button. When the delete button of a task is clicked, that task should be removed from the list.
   - Implement error handling: If the input field is empty and the user tries to add a task, display an error message or alert.

This challenge will test your skills in handling user input, manipulating the DOM, and managing events in JavaScript. Give it a try, and feel free to ask for hints or guidance if you encounter any difficulties!
